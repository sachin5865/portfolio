This project is a portfolio where a user can showcase their skills in front of the job interview. And update their skills which he/she currently working on and which project they recently completed.
It is helpful for jobs and interviews.

which technology I used to create this project
-- HTML
-- CSS
Currently, I'm using only these because I design this project for an intership but I will continue this project with some latest technology like REACT JS.

Thanks to codeClause
